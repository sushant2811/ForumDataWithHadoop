# ForumDataWithHadoop

##Capstone project for the Udacity's course #617 (Introduction to Hadoop and MapReduce)

Data mining on discussion-forum data.

Runs MapReduce algorithms to examine things like the time when students are most active, 
correlation between the length of the question and the mean length of answers, and the top 10 
popular tags in the discussion boards. 

The MapReduce implementation is first tested locally on small subset of data and then the 
Hadoop job is run on a virtual machine which has cloudera's distribution of Hadoop pre-installed. 

Further work: 

1) Do ML on the output. 

2) Complete part 4.
